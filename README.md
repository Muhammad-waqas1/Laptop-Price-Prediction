## Laptop Price Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for a project aiming to predict laptop prices based on their specifications.

**Project Goal:**

Develop a machine learning model to predict the price of a laptop given its features, such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage capacity, etc. This model will be helpful for potential buyers to estimate the cost of a laptop based on their desired configuration.

**Project Structure:**

* `data`: This folder will contain the laptop dataset used for training and testing the model.
* `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
* `models`: This folder will store trained model files (if applicable). 
* `requirements.txt`: This file specifies the Python libraries needed to run the project.
* `README.md`: This file (you are currently reading it!).

**Project Stages:**

1. **Data Exploration:**
    * Analyze the provided laptop dataset to understand the features and their potential impact on price prediction.
    * Clean and pre-process the data to ensure its quality for model training.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
    * Create new features from existing ones or transform them to improve the model's learning capability.
    * This might involve encoding categorical features or scaling numerical features.
3. **Model Selection and Training:**
    * Implement appropriate regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or Gradient Boosting Regression.
    * Train the chosen models on the prepared data, splitting it into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluate the trained models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the testing set.
    * Compare the performance of different models to choose the best one for prediction.
    * Consider using techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

**Pro Tips:**

* Consider using ensemble methods like Random Forest Regression or Gradient Boosting Regression for potentially higher accuracy.
* Utilize cross-validation techniques to assess the model's robustness on unseen data points.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the laptop dataset (if not provided) and place it in the `data` folder.
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment and follow the instructions within.
